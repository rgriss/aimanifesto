- [ ] Deployed

## Metadata
- **Feature ID:** FEAT-001
- **Created:** 2025-10-10
- **Owner:** Ryan Grissinger
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Target Release:** v1.1
- **Related Issues:** N/A

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Currently, adding a new AI tool to the directory requires manual entry through the admin interface. As the maintainer who regularly evaluates and reviews AI tools, I want to be able to describe a tool conversationally to my AI assistant (Claude/ChatGPT) and have it automatically create the directory entry.

### Who experiences this problem?
- Primary: Ryan (site maintainer and tool reviewer)
- Secondary: Future content contributors who may want to submit tools

### Why is this important?
- **Efficiency:** Reduces time to add new tools from ~5 minutes to ~30 seconds
- **Workflow Integration:** Allows tool addition during natural research/review process
- **Quality:** AI can help structure and format information consistently
- **Dogfooding:** Demonstrates integration between AI assistants and our platform
- **Foundation:** Creates infrastructure for future AI-powered features

## Proposed Solution

### User Story
As a tool reviewer,
I want to describe a new AI tool to my AI assistant in natural language,
So that the tool is automatically added to the directory without manual data entry.

### Key Features
1. **RESTful API endpoint** for creating tools
2. **Token-based authentication** to secure the API
3. **MCP integration** allowing Claude to call the API directly
4. **Intelligent field mapping** from conversational description to database fields
5. **Validation and error handling** with clear feedback

### User Experience

**Ideal Flow:**
1. User (Ryan) researches a new AI tool (e.g., browsing their website)
2. User says to Claude: "Add this tool to my directory: [description]"
3. Claude extracts relevant information (name, URL, features, pricing, etc.)
4. Claude calls the API to create the tool
5. Claude confirms success and provides the tool's page URL
6. User can immediately view/edit the tool in the admin panel if needed

**Example Interaction:**
```
User: "Add Claude to my AI tools directory. It's made by Anthropic, 
      available at claude.ai, costs $20/month for Pro. Key features 
      include 200K context window, artifacts for code generation, 
      and computer use capabilities."

Claude: "I've added Claude to your AI tools directory! Here's what I created:
        - Name: Claude
        - Website: https://claude.ai
        - Pricing: $20/month (Pro plan)
        - Key features: 200K context, artifacts, computer use
        
        View it here: https://aimanifesto.com/tools/claude
        
        You can edit or add more details in your admin panel."
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] API endpoint accepts tool data as JSON
- [ ] Token authentication validates requests
- [ ] Tool is created in database with all provided fields
- [ ] Response includes created tool data and success status
- [ ] MCP tool allows Claude to call the API
- [ ] Basic validation prevents duplicate tools (by name/URL)
- [ ] API returns appropriate error messages for invalid data

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] Auto-generate slug from tool name
- [ ] Support for all Tool model fields (features array, integrations, etc.)
- [ ] Category can be specified or auto-suggested
- [ ] Logo URL can be provided or left blank
- [ ] Response includes direct link to tool page
- [ ] API rate limiting (basic protection)

### Nice to Have (P2)
- [ ] AI can update existing tools
- [ ] AI can search for existing tools before creating
- [ ] Webhook notification when tool is created
- [ ] Draft mode (tool created as inactive/unpublished)
- [ ] Automatic logo fetching from website favicon

---

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- Existing Tool model and database structure
- Laravel API routing
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server setup
- Environment variables for API token storage

### Constraints
- Must maintain existing admin interface functionality
- Tool creation must respect all existing validation rules
- Database schema should not require modifications
- Must work with both Claude and potentially other AI assistants

### Security Implications
- API token must be stored securely in .env
- Token should be revocable/rotatable
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Consider IP whitelisting for added security

### Performance Considerations
- API response should be <500ms for tool creation
- No impact on existing website performance
- Consider async processing if logo fetching is implemented

---

## Out of Scope

This feature will NOT include:
- Public API access (only for authorized AI assistants)
- Bulk tool import functionality
- AI-generated tool descriptions (user provides description)
- Automatic categorization via AI
- Tool verification/approval workflow
- Email notifications to other team members
- Integration with other tool directories

---

## Open Questions

1. Should the API allow updating existing tools, or only creation?
2. Do we want to validate/verify URLs are accessible before saving?
3. Should there be a "draft" status for AI-created tools?
4. How do we handle categories? Auto-create if doesn't exist, or require valid category_id?
5. Should we log all API calls for audit purposes?

---

## Success Metrics

### How will we measure success?
- **Adoption:** 80% of new tools added via API within first month
- **Time Savings:** Average time to add tool reduced from 5 min to <1 min
- **Quality:** No increase in incomplete tool entries compared to manual entry
- **Reliability:** <1% API error rate
- **User Satisfaction:** Personal assessment that workflow feels natural

## Timeline

- **Specification:** 2025-10-10 (Same day)
- **Development:** 2025-10-10 to 2025-10-11 (1-2 days)
- **Testing:** 2025-10-11 (Same day as dev)
- **Deployment:** 2025-10-11 or 2025-10-12

## Notes

### Context
This is our first formal feature request using the new documentation process. It serves as both:
1. A functional requirement for a needed feature
2. An example of our documentation standards
3. A test of our "dogfooding" philosophy

### Related Philosophy
This feature embodies our principle of "code to the interface, not the implementation." The AI assistant doesn't need to know about our Laravel backend, database structure, or admin panel - it just needs a clean API contract.

### Future Considerations
Once this foundation is in place, we could extend to:
- Tool update API
- Category management API
- Bulk operations
- Public API with OAuth for third-party submissions
- AI-powered tool discovery and suggestion
